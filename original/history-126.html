Historical information was obtained from the .Historic Salisbury Houses. by Paul S. Shaw, MD
</p><p>
Salisbury settlers built many magnificent large period Colonials around the mid 1700.s.  This early town flourished because it was on the .N.H. Turnpike. which was then the main artery from Boston to Montreal. At the height the population was around 3,000.  The population decreased during the Civil War as young men travelled out of the area and many families moved west. Industrialization, the new railroad thru Franklin, and alternate east and West routes left this community to dwindle to 700 residents. Today about 1,200 reside here.
</p><p>
Captain John Webster, a fine statesman among many here, was the uncle to our famous Daniel Webster; a character building family among the early settlers of Salisbury.
</p><p>
In 1760, Captain John had his first Colonial built and in 1788 deeded it to son Ensign John Webster, Jr.
</p><p>
Captain John built this fine, stately Colonial in 1770 where it is beautifully set on a spacious one acre parcel in an area of other historic homes.
</p><p>
This grand Colonial boasts 8 fireplaces, beehive ovens, raised panel walls and doors, front to back center hall with entry doors at both ends. The front door is 44.. There is a unique chair rail, raised paneled center stairwell, large crown moldings and even a well inside the old summer kitchen for access to water year round.
</p><p>
This property has been home to many over the last 239 years. The most recent is the Britton Family. Al &amp; Elinor Britton purchased the property in 1970. They enjoyed the warmth and character of this comfortable home and found it a wonderful place to raise their five children.
