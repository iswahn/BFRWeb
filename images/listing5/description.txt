Dipping pools here & there & great tubbing or shallow beam kayaking - what fun! Many rooms with early ERA paneled walls, large gunstock corners, all pine floors. This is in Excellent Condition, an easy keeper. Be a part of Warner life, yet only 14 miles on I-89, on a super safe loop for kids & animals. A lot of value in this price range.</div>
